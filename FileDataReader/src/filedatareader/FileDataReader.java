/**
 * Reading files from a file is something that commonly needs to be done in both 
 * large and small scale applications. This class offers an easy way to read files 
 * into different formats and to search through files by using regex codes. It
 * significantly simplifies the way that files are read and for most projects
 * it offers all the needed functionality.
 * <p>
 * <b>This class reads the entire file as a whole. Therefore it should not be
 * used for reading large files. When reading 500MB files, the RAM usage of the application
 * will increase with at least that amount. {@code FileDataReader} was written for
 * reading and searching through small files from between 0 - 200MB (and 
 * depending on the available RAM, up to 750MB).</b>
 * 
 * <h1>Basic usage</h1>
 * 
 * When reading files with {@code FileDataReader}, the path to the file has to 
 * be set first by using the {@link #setPath(String)} and {@link #setPath(File)} methods. 
 * Then, the entire file (provided that it exists) is immediately read into memory.
 * 
 * <h2>Data retrieval</h2>
 * 
 * The data can be obtained in multiple ways. The data can be retrieved in multiple
 * ways. The main methods for retrieving data are through the methods {@link #getDataBytes()}
 * which returns the bytes of the file, {@link #getDataString()} which returns the
 * content of the file in one {@code String}, {@link #getDataStringLines()} which
 * returns the content of the file in a {@code List} with each element in the {@code List}
 * representing a line of the file and {@link #getNumericDataLines()} which converts
 * each line to a numeric value (provided that the lines are numeric). The code
 * snippet below shows a small example of {@code FileDataReader} usage.
 * 
 * <pre><i>
 *      // The following won't work, as no path has been set yet...
 *      FileDataReader reader = new FileDataReader();
 *      try {
 *          reader.getDataStringLines();
 *      } catch(Exception e) {
 *          System.out.println("Oops, forget to set the path that has to be read...");
 *      }
 * 
 *      // Lets set a path and print all the lines of the file
 *      try {
 *          reader.setPath("C:\\Users\\SomeUser\\Desktop\\file.txt");
 *          for(String line : reader.getDataStringLines()) {
 *              System.out.println(line);
 *          }
 *      } catch(IOException e) {
 *          e.printStackTrace();
 *      }
 * </i></pre>
 * 
 * <h2>Searching through files</h2>
 * 
 * {@code FileDataReader} also offers some useful tools for searching through
 * files. It does this with the use of regex codes. The main methods for searching
 * through files are {@link #containsMatch(String)} which looks if a match for the
 * given regex code is found in the file and {@link #getRegexMatches(String, boolean)} 
 * which obtains all matches in the file for the given regex code. {@link #getRegexMatches(String, boolean)}
 * makes use of the {@code Match} class in which matches are conveniently stored
 * and made accessible. The code snippet below shows an example of searching through
 * a file with the following text:
 * 
 * <pre><i>
 * the quick brown fox
 * the quick brown
 *  fox
 * the quick brown
 * fox
 * the quick bro
 * wn
 *  f
 * ox
 * </i></pre>
 * 
 * In the following code we search through the text above for matches with "brown fox".
 * Multi-line matches are also accepted.
 * 
 * <pre><i>{@code
 *      // We asume that we already have made a FileDataReader for the text above
 *      List<Match> matches = reader.getRegexMatches("brown fox", true);
 *      
 *      // Print all matches 
 *      for(Match m : matches) {
 *          System.out.println("Startline: " + m.getStartLine() + ", Endline: " + m.getEndLine());
 *      }
 * }</i></pre>
 * 
 * This code should give the following output:
 * <pre><i>
 * Startline: 0, Endline: 0
 * Startline: 1, Endline: 2
 * Startline: 5, Endline: 8
 * </i></pre>
