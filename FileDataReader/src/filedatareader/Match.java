/**
 * This class is used to store regex matches. The class has been written in such
 * a way that it can also be used for multi-line regex matches. 
 * 
 * <h2>Usage for multi-line matches</h2>
 * The {@code Match} class is capable of storing additional information of matches
 * in an environment where regex codes are used over multiple lines (for example,
 * when reading a text document and using regex codes to match over multiple lines at once). 
 * This class is capable of also storing the index of the lines at which the matches/groups
 * started and ended.
 * <p>
 * For storing multi-line matches, we recommend using the {@link #Match(Matcher, int[])}
 * constructor. The {@code int[]} parameter should contain the cumulative line sizes
 * of the text which was matched. To illustrate this, we provide an example below
 * with the following text:
 * 
 * <pre><i>
 * the quick brown fox
 * the quick brown
 *  fox
 * the quick brown
 * fox
 * the quick bro
 * wn
 *  f
 * ox
 * </i></pre>
 * 
 * The lengths of each line are (in order): 19, 15, 4, 15, 3, 13, 2, 2, 2.
 * Their cumulative sizes (starting from the first line) are then: 19, 34, 38,
 * 53, 56, 69, 71, 73, 75. These cumulative values should be stored in an integer
 * array so that the {@code Match} class can deduce at which lines a match/group started
 * and ended.
